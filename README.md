# Australia Population Density Map üåè

## Overview
This project visualizes the population density of Australia using geospatial tools. The map highlights key urban centers, such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, while illustrating the sparse population in the interior regions.

- **Tools Used**:
  - QGIS: For geospatial data processing and map preparation.
  - Aerialod: For 3D rendering and visualization.

## Features
- **3D Elevation Representation**: Population density visualized as peaks and valleys.
- **Coastal vs. Inland Analysis**: Emphasizes the stark contrast in settlement patterns.
- **Customizable Layers**: Ready to integrate additional data like infrastructure, land use, or climate zones.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `map_files/`: QGIS and Aerialod project files.
- `outputs/`: Final outputs, including map images and videos.
- `docs/`: Documentation, guides, and other supporting materials.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and visualization.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Australia-Population-Density-Map.git
